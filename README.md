üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

An OpenAI API Key

Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
All the required packages are listed in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Your OpenAI API Key:
The application needs your OpenAI API key to function. The best way to do this is by setting it as an environment variable.

On Windows (Command Prompt):

set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

On macOS/Linux:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

Note: You will need to set this variable every time you open a new terminal. For deployment, you will set this as a "Secret" in Streamlit Community Cloud.

Usage
The application must be run in a specific order the first time to ensure the database is created correctly.

Run the App:
Start the Streamlit application from your main project directory.

streamlit run app.py

Add a Job (as a Recruiter):

A browser tab will open to the app's homepage.

In the sidebar on the left, navigate to the Recruiter Admin Panel.

Fill in the details for a new job posting and click "Process and Save JD". This will create and populate the results.db database file.

Analyze a Resume (as a Job Seeker):

In the sidebar, navigate to the Job Seeker Portal.

You will now see the job you just created.

Upload your resume for that job and click "Analyze with AI" to see the full, multi-tab analysis.
